# Blog Project (Week 4)

## What is This Project?

This week's project is a Blog website designed to display and interact with blog posts.

- **Why Did I Make This?**: To practice and enhance my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript by creating a dynamic and responsive blog application. This project was inspired by the "Revelations" blogs from the SEGA franchise "Like a Dragon," with the dark mode palette drawing inspiration from the signature colors of the series' main character, Kazuma Kiryu.
- **What's in It?**: The application includes a main page and a blog page. Users can navigate between these pages, toggle between light and dark modes, and interact by submitting blog posts. The footer links to my portfolio page from Homework-2, and the back button takes you back to the main page to submit another blog entry.
- **What Did I Learn?**: This project helped me understand the integration of HTML and JavaScript to create a cohesive user experience. I learned about DOM manipulation and the importance of maintaining consistent styling across different pages (Although I feel like I could've improved the stylizing on the blog page to better match the index page). I also gained more experience in organizing styles and scripts efficiently.

## Credits

A heartfelt thank you to my bootcamp instructors and peers for their continuous guidance and support. Special thanks to W3schools and MDN for their comprehensive resources on JavaScript and HTML, and to Web.dev for their insightful tutorials and podcast on CSS, which made learning enjoyable even during work. The tutorials and documentation from these sites were invaluable in helping me understand various concepts like local storage keys, using JSON.stringify, and implementing the functionality for this project.
